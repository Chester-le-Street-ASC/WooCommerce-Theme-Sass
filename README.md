# Chester-le-Street ASC Sass CSS
This is the SASS CSS repository for Chester-le-Street ASC's Global Styles. [Using Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Sass Homepage") on your computer, you can compile these files into CSS for use in any projects.

We use [the Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) for our work because it provides a solid foundation for our responsive web design, and means bugs will be dealt with by the wider community.
